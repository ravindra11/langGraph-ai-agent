# LangGraph
 -  `LangGraph` is a low-level orchestration framework for building controllable agents. 
 -  While `langchain` provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development, the langGraph library enables agent orchestration -- offering customizable architectures, long-term memory, and human-in-loop to reliably handle complex tasks.
 
 # Why use LangGraph ?
  - LangGraph is built for developers who want to build powerful, adaptable AI agents.
  - Developer choose LangGraph for:

  - # Reliability and controllability
    - steer agent actions with moderation checks and human-in-the-loop approvals.
    - LandGraph persists context for long running workflows, keeping your agents on course

    # Low-level and extensible
    - Build custom agents with fully descriptive, low-level primitives free from rigid abstractions that limit customization.
    - Design scalable multi-agent systems, with each agent serving a specific role tailored to your use case.

    # First-class streaming support
     - With token-by-oken streaming and streaming of intermediate steps, LangGraph gives users clear visibility into agents reasoning and actions as they unfold in real time.


# LangGraph Ecosystem
 - while langGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with given to developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pain LangGraph with
 - ## LangSmith 
    - Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
